    <h2 id="heard" class="morning">Heard of Jessica Hische?</h2>

      <p> If you have, great!
If you haven’t, don’t worry, this web page has got you covered on the basics!
First and foremost, as an award-winning designer, Jessica’s work in lettering and typography has led her to collaborations with well-known international brands such as Tiffany & Co., Starbucks, The New York Times, Penguin Books, and American Express. Jessica's incredible achievements in lettering have also gained her a place in the “Forbes 30 under 30” award for being one of the brightest young stars in Art and Design
<cite>(Hische, 2012)</cite>.</p>

<p>The old saying goes that designers have to wear “many hats", Jessica fits this stereotype with grace. She is known for more than just her lettering skills; she is also an illustrator, book author, business owner, and recently a proud wife and mother.

      <h2 >Early years</h2>
  <img src="Img/01.png" alt="pic of man and woman" class="img1" align="left" style="margin: 0px 13px -35px 0px;""/>

     <p>From a young age, Jessica felt compelled to draw. In an interview with Designboom, Jessica revealed that in grade school, her love of art led her to many mischiefs. Admitting to the fact that she used to draw her classmates’ names in bubble letters and graffiti them onto their trapper keepers<cite>(Butler, 2014).</cite></P>

     <p>In 2002 Jessica graduated from Hazleton Area High School. She then went on to study at Tyler School of Art where Jessica found herself drawn to design. Jessica liked how design projects often have a solid starting point and structure, rather than other art forms such as fine art which she finds too loose and self-expressive. With design tasks, there was often problems to be solved and Jessica enjoyed the challenge posed by them<cite>(Butler, 2014).</cite>
    </P>

    <p>Although Jessica found her calling in school, one advice she often gave to confused students still in search their passion to look at what sort of work they are doing while procrastinating: </P>

 <p><blockquote><i>“The work you do while you procrastinate is probably the work you should be doing for the rest of your life.”<cite>(Hische, 2015)</i></cite></blockquote></p>

<P>After graduating in 2006 with a BFA, Jessica worked for Headcase Design in Philadelphia before moving to Brooklyn as Senior Designer at Louise Fili's studio. While working at Fili’s studio, Jessica found herself with fascinated with a niche topic in design - lettering. At first, lettering was just a decorative component within her designs. Eventually, she found herself offering design solutions based entirely off lettering and soon clients were hiring her to specifically do the lettering work for Magazines, headlines and logos <cite>(Hische, 2021).</cite>Through this experience, Jessica discovered that there was a career out there for those who could customise typefaces.</P>

    <h2 id="street">That drop cap girl</h2>
        <p>In late 2009 Jessica decided to start her own independent business in illustration and type design. Jessica notes that she is a risk-averse person, and the fear that comes along with opening a business meant that she had to take a huge leap of faith. In an interview with Abode, Jessica looks back on her journey of entrepreneurship and calls for artist to not be scared of failure:</P>

<p><blockquote>"Achieving is great, but the real accomplishment is pushing through the initial fear to actually start doing something." <cite>(Nygaard, 2021)</cite></blockquote></P>

<p>While growing her freelancing career, Jessica started a website called the “Daily Drop cap ”. This website was her personal side project, and the goal was to keep herself motivated during the times when the client-side of the work weren’t so interesting. Every day she would post on the Daily Drop Cap a brand new, self-made, and beautifully embellished initial cap with the added bonus that fellow designers can download the caps and use it in their own work for free.</P>

  <p>Within days of launching the website, Jessica’s work was featured in numerous design blogs and received enormous amount of popularity. This was the steppingstone that capsulated Jessica into the design scene. So many of Jessica’s clients were introduced to her through the “Daily Drop Cap” that she has since gained the nickname of “that drop cap girl”<cite>(Hische, 2011).</cite></P>

 <p>Fast forward to today, Jessica’s business is now thriving with big-name clients like The New York Times and American Express. Jessica stresses the importance of having personal projects, as it is through the “Daily Drop Cap” where Jessica found her first breakthrough. She knows that a lot of times artists feel as if they are at the mercy of their clients, but she encourages everyone to regain control in their careers through personal projects. For it is through these projects that artists can get a chance show potential clients their strength, and it is a good way to showcase their best work to the public<cite>(Co, 2016).</cite>

  <h2>A quick look at Jessica's design process</h2>

   <p>As a keen letterer, it will come as no surprise that Jessica has produced several commercial typefaces which is available for purchase. Jessica’s first made her first typeface Buttermilk™ back in 2008, and it is also one of her most popular typeface to this day. When it comes to the medium she expresses her creativity through, Jessica is also an incredibly versatile artist. Her lettering work has beautified magazines, logos, illustrations, and posters alike. Jessica’s self-illustrated and self-written books have also reached New York times bestseller status.</P>

   <p>In an earlier section, we discussed why Jessica preferred design over more lose forms of art. She liked how there were rules, frameworks, and problems to solve in design, whereas something like fine art proved to be too self-expressive for her. If we look through Jessica's design projects today, it might amaze us to see that a lot of her designs are super expressive and whimsical. Jessica's lettering styles are known to be very extravagant and eye-catching, however, her designs have more than what meets the eye.</P>

   <P>Taking Buttermilk™ for example, from the first look the letters screams “decorative”. The whole feel of the typeface is very playful and bubbly due to each individual letter having exaggerated curves and puffy bodies. However, if we look closer, all the letters follow a set of similar rules and the design is very technical - the curves of the letters get more exaggerated and thinner towards the edges, and when not joined up, all letters have black dots accenting their end tips. Although Jessica's letterings project appears to be ornamented and expressive, the skill to communicate both visual impacts with coherency requires a good understanding of the design fundamentals.</P>

  <div class="Buttermilk"><img src="Img/buttermilk.png" alt="Buttermilk pic" title=""/></div>

   <P>A good case study in which Jessica demonstrates "form follows function" is the “Change takes courage” poster project Jessica did in collaboration with Oliva Wide on Skillshare<cite>(Words With Meaning With Olivia Wilde, 2020).</cite> Since the poster (picture below) is designed for Oliva’s children, the front Jessica chooses is bold and more simplistic than most of her more elaborative font styles. Jessica explained that when she is designing for children, her front style becomes bolder and simpler for ease of reading; compared to when she wishes to draw an adult's attention, that is when her style becomes a little bit more complicated.<P>

     <div class=Screenshot><img src="Img/Screenshot.png" alt="screenshot of Jessica's work from youtube" title=""/></div>


  <P>Once the font is decided, Jessica considers hierarchy. She tends to give the words that require emphasis a larger font size. We can see that the words “Change” and “Courage” send the most important message in this project. Which is why Jessica and Oliva are making these two specific words bigger in size, allowing them stand out.  </P>

   <p>Lastly, Jessica decides on the layout and how the words will be positioned across the page. For this poster project, since there are only three words, Jessica can afford to be more playful with the layout of her design. In the end, she chooses to make the words arched instead of making them sit on 3 straight lines. The arched words add an element of fun for the children, but at the same time avoids too much empty spaces to the middle left and right of the page. After considering all the important elements in design, Jessica doesn’t forget to add sprinkles of creativity into her work. Apart from the bubbly writing and arched letters, we see that Jessica has also added some creative touches - extra-long curly endings for letters such as “ R”, “S”, and “t”.This extra attention to lettering details is very much a signature style of Jessica’s work.</P>

      <h2>conclusion</h2>

      <P>Jessica first came into the art scene by simply following her passion for lettering and design, but ultimately, her freelance career took off becuase of her talent, hard work (client work plus personal side projects), and a great understanding of how to apply creativity to design.</p>

      <p>Through studying how Jessica approaches her design projects, we can clear the misconception that “designing" is the same as "drawing". The two are related, but ultimately a good design strives to solve a communication problem visually. Jessica’s designs know how to maximise its visual delivery to effectively communicate with its audiences. whether that be choosing a typeface that is easier to read for young children or making the words bigger to catch attention. All the while she manages to sprinkle in her signature style and creativity, something that is so vital as a designer when you have your own brand.</P>
